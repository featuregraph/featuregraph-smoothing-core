"""
Tests for the ground-truth validation module (characterize_signal,
match_breaths, compute_canonical_indices).

Three tiers, same pattern as test_oscillation.py:

1. Synthetic tests that pass right now, with no network access, proving
   the transcribed logic actually works -- not just that it imports.
2. A synthetic phase-mismatch test, specifically chosen to reproduce
   the shape of the real finding (BIDMC annotators mark peaks, not
   troughs -- matching against the wrong one gives near-zero recall).
3. The real end-to-end computation against actual BIDMC data. Confirmed
   passing on 2026-09-24 against N=32 subjects (53 minus 16 with no
   reliable ACF period, minus 5 flagged, with some overlap between those
   two groups) -- see that test's skip reason for the full figures.
   Left skipped by default so routine runs don't require a real
   PhysioNet download every time.
